# Contributing to Scout

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Scout! We welcome any help to make this tool better.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or improving documentation, to submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Scout itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/scout-io/scout/issues). <!-- TODO: Update with your actual repo URL -->

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/scout-io/scout/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/scout-io/scout/issues/new) with the label "enhancement". Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and its potential benefits.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (or `develop` if it exists).
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Styleguide

We generally follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please run a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) before submitting your changes.

### Frontend Styleguide

(TODO: Specify frontend style guidelines if applicable, e.g., Prettier, ESLint rules)
